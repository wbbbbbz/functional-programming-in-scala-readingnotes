FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING IN SCALA
The following set of sections represent the exercises contained in the book "Functional Programming in Scala", written by Paul Chiusano and RÃºnar Bjarnason and published by Manning. This content library is meant to be used in tandem with the book. We use the same numeration for the exercises for you to follow them.

THE OPTION DATA TYPE
Exercise 4.1:

We're going to look at some of the functions available in the Option, starting by map, that applies a function f in the Option is not None:
```scala
def map[B](f: A => B): Option[B] = this match {
  case None => None
  case Some(a) => Some(f(a))
}
```
Let's try it out:
```scala
def lookupByName(name: String): Option[Employee] =
  name match {
    case "Joe" => Some(Employee("Joe", "Finances", Some("Julie")))
    case "Mary" => Some(Employee("Mary", "IT", None))
    case "Izumi" => Some(Employee("Izumi", "IT", Some("Mary")))
    case _ => None
  }

/*
 We can look for our employees, and try to obtain their departments. We will assume that we won't find any errors,
 and if it's the case, we don't have to worry as the computation will end there. Try to use `map` on the result of
 calling `lookupByName` to create a function to obtain the department of each employee. Hint: to access the
 optional employee, use Scala's underscore notation. i.e.:

 _.getOrElse(Employee("John", "Doe", None))

 Employee is defined as:

 case class Employee(name: String, department: String, manager: Option[String])
 */
def getDepartment: (Option[Employee]) => Option[String] = 
e => e map (_.department)


getDepartment(lookupByName("Joe")) shouldBe Some("Finances")
getDepartment(lookupByName("Mary")) shouldBe Some("IT")
getDepartment(lookupByName("Foo")) shouldBe None
We can also implement flatMap, which applies a function f which may also fail, to the Option if not None:

def flatMap[B](f: A => Option[B]): Option[B] = map(f) getOrElse None
Try to find out who is managing each employee, if applicable:

def getManager: (Option[Employee]) => Option[String] = 
e => e flatMap(_.manager)


getManager(lookupByName("Joe")) shouldBe Some("Julie")
getManager(lookupByName("Mary")) shouldBe None
getManager(lookupByName("Foo")) shouldBe None
```
The function getOrElse tries to get the value contained in the Option, but if it's a None, it will return the default value provided by the caller:
```scala
def getOrElse[B >: A](default: => B): B = this match {
  case None => default
  case Some(a) => a
}
```
orElse returns the original Option if not None, or returns the provided Option as an alternative in that case:
```scala
def orElse[B >: A](ob: => Option[B]): Option[B] = this map (Some(_)) getOrElse ob
Check how it works in the following exercise:

def getManager(employee: Option[Employee]): Option[String] = employee.flatMap(_.manager)

getManager(lookupByName("Joe")).orElse(Some("Mr. CEO")) shouldBe 
Some("Julie")

getManager(lookupByName("Mary")).orElse(Some("Mr. CEO")) shouldBe 
Some("Mr. CEO")

getManager(lookupByName("Foo")).orElse(Some("Mr. CEO")) shouldBe 
Some("Mr. CEO")
```
Finally, we can implement a filter function that will turn any Option into a None if it doesn't satisfy the provided predicate:
```scala
def filter(f: A => Boolean): Option[A] = this match {
  case Some(a) if f(a) => this
  case _ => None
}
```
Test it out by discarding those employees who belong to the IT department:
```scala
lookupByName("Joe").filter(_.department != "IT") shouldBe 
Some(Employee("Joe", "Finances", Some("Julie")))

lookupByName("Mary").filter(_.department != "IT") shouldBe 
None

lookupByName("Foo").filter(_.department != "IT") shouldBe 
None
```
Exercise 4.2:

Let's implement the variance function in terms of flatMap. If the mean of a sequence is m, the variance is the mean of math.pow(x - m, 2) for each element in the sequence:
```scala
def variance(xs: Seq[Double]): Option[Double] =
  mean(xs) flatMap (m => mean(xs.map(x => math.pow(x - m, 2))))
```
Exercise 4.3:

Let's write a generic function to combine two Option values , so that if any of those values is None, the result value is too; and otherwise it will be the result of applying the provided function:
```scala
def map2[A, B, C](a: Option[A], b: Option[B])(f: (A, B) => C): Option[C] =
  a flatMap (aa => b map (bb => f(aa, bb)))
```
Exercise 4.4:

Let's continue by looking at a few other similar cases. For instance, the sequence function, which combines a list of Options into another Option containing a list of all the Somes in the original one. If the original list contains None at least once, the result of the function should be None. If not, the result should be a Some with a list of all the values:
```scala
def sequence(a: List[Option[A]]): Option[List[A]] = a match {
  case Nil => Some(Nil)
  case h :: t => h flatMap (hh => sequence(t) map (hh :: _))
}
```
After taking a look at the implementation, see how it works in the following exercise:
```scala
sequence(List(Some(1), Some(2), Some(3))) shouldBe 
Some(List(1, 2, 3))

sequence(List(Some(1), Some(2), None)) shouldBe 
None
```
Exercise 4.5:

The last Option function we're going to explore is traverse, that will allow us to map over a list using a function that might fail, returning None if applying it to any element of the list returns None:
```scala
def traverse[A, B](a: List[A])(f: A => Option[B]): Option[List[B]] = a match {
  case Nil => Some(Nil)
  case h :: t => map2(f(h), traverse(t)(f))(_ :: _)
}
```
We can also implement traverse in terms of foldRight:
```scala
def traverse_1[A, B](a: List[A])(f: A => Option[B]): Option[List[B]] =
  a.foldRight[Option[List[B]]](Some(Nil))((h, t) => map2(f(h), t)(_ :: _))
```
We can even re-implement sequence in terms of traverse:
```scala
def sequenceViaTraverse[A](a: List[Option[A]]): Option[List[A]] = traverse(a)(x => x)
```
Let's try traverse out, by trying to parse a List[String] into a Option[List[Int]]:
```scala
val list1 = List("1", "2", "3")
val list2 = List("I", "II", "III", "IV")

def parseInt(a: String): Option[Int] =
  Try(a.toInt) match {
    case Success(r) => Some(r)
    case _ => None
  }

traverse(list1)(i => parseInt(i)) shouldBe 
Some(List(1, 2, 3))

traverse(list2)(i => parseInt(i)) shouldBe 
None
```
THE EITHER DATA TYPE
Exercise 4.6:

As we did with Option, let's implement versions of map, flatMap, orElse and map2 on Either that operate on the Right value, starting with map:
```scala
def map[B](f: A => B): Either[E, B] = this match {
  case Right(a) => Right(f(a))
  case Left(e) => Left(e)
}
```
In the same fashion as Option, map allows us to chain operations on an Either without worrying about the possible errors that may arise, as the chain will stop if any error occurs. Let's try it out, by improving the employee lookup function we implemented before, to use Either instead of Option. Try to use map on the Either type to obtain the department of each employee:
```scala
def lookupByNameViaEither(name: String): Either[String, Employee] =
  name match {
    case "Joe" => Right(Employee("Joe", "Finances", Some("Julie")))
    case "Mary" => Right(Employee("Mary", "IT", None))
    case "Izumi" => Right(Employee("Izumi", "IT", Some("Mary")))
    case _ => Left("Employee not found")
  }

def getDepartment: (Either[String, Employee]) => Either[String, String] = 
e => e map (_.department)


getDepartment(lookupByNameViaEither("Joe")) shouldBe Right("Finances")
getDepartment(lookupByNameViaEither("Mary")) shouldBe Right("IT")
getDepartment(lookupByNameViaEither("Foo")) shouldBe Left("Employee not found")
```
flatMap behaves the same in Either as it does in Option, allowing us to chain operations that may also fail. Use it to try to obtain the managers from each employee. Note that when calling our getManager function, we can find two different errors in its execution:
```scala
def getManager(employee: Either[String, Employee]): Either[String, String] =
  employee.flatMap(e =>
    e.manager match {
      case Some(e) => Right(e)
      case _ => Left("Manager not found")
    })

getManager(lookupByNameViaEither("Joe")) shouldBe 
Right("Julie")

getManager(lookupByNameViaEither("Mary")) shouldBe 
Left("Manager not found")

getManager(lookupByNameViaEither("Foo")) shouldBe 
Left("Employee not found")
```
orElse works the same as in Options, returning the original Either when it contains a Right, or the provided alternative in case it's a Left:
```scala
def orElse[EE >: E, AA >: A](b: => Either[EE, AA]): Either[EE, AA] = this match {
  case Left(_) => b
  case Right(a) => Right(a)
}
```
Let's check out how it behaves. Let's assume that everyone inside our company ends up responding to a "Mr. CEO" manager. We can provide that logic with orElse:
```scala
def getManager(employee: Either[String, Employee]): Either[String, String] =
  employee.flatMap(e =>
    e.manager match {
      case Some(e) => Right(e)
      case _ => Left("Manager not found")
    })

getManager(lookupByNameViaEither("Joe")).orElse(Right("Mr. CEO")) shouldBe 
Right("Julie")

getManager(lookupByNameViaEither("Mary")).orElse(Right("Mr. CEO")) shouldBe 
Right("Mr. CEO")

getManager(lookupByNameViaEither("Foo")).orElse(Right("Mr. CEO")) shouldBe 
Right("Mr. CEO")
```
In the same fashion as with Options, map2 lets us combine two Eithers using a binary function. Note that we will use for-comprehensions instead of a chain of flatMap and map calls:
```scala
def map2[EE >: E, B, C](b: Either[EE, B])(f: (A, B) => C): Either[EE, C] =
  for {
    a <- this;
    b1 <- b
  } yield f(a, b1)
```
In this implementation, we can't report errors on both sides. To do that, we would need a new data type that can hold a list of errors:
```scala
trait Partial[+A, +B]
case class Errors[+A](get: Seq[A]) extends Partial[A, Nothing]
case class Success[+B](get: B) extends Partial[Nothing, B]
```
This data type is really similar to Scalaz' Validation type.

In any case, let's test map2 on the following exercise, to find out if two employees share a department by using an specific function:
```scala
def employeesShareDepartment(employeeA: Employee, employeeB: Employee) =
  employeeA.department == employeeB.department

lookupByNameViaEither("Joe").map2(lookupByNameViaEither("Mary"))(
  employeesShareDepartment) shouldBe 
Right(false)

lookupByNameViaEither("Mary").map2(lookupByNameViaEither("Izumi"))(
  employeesShareDepartment) shouldBe 
Right(true)

lookupByNameViaEither("Foo").map2(lookupByNameViaEither("Izumi"))(
  employeesShareDepartment) shouldBe 
Left("Employee not found")
```
Exercise 4.7:

sequence and traverse can also be implemented for Either. Those functions should return the first error that can be found, if there is one.
```scala
def traverse[E, A, B](es: List[A])(f: A => Either[E, B]): Either[E, List[B]] = es match {
  case Nil => Right(Nil)
  case h :: t => (f(h) map2 traverse(t)(f))(_ :: _)
}
def sequence[E, A](es: List[Either[E, A]]): Either[E, List[A]] = traverse(es)(x => x)
We can attempt to obtain a record of employees names by looking up a list of Employees:

val employees = List("Joe", "Mary")
val employeesAndOutsources = employees :+ "Foo"

Either.traverse(employees)(lookupByNameViaEither) shouldBe 
Right(List(Employee("Joe", "Finances", Some("Julie")), Employee("Mary", "IT", None)))

Either.traverse(employeesAndOutsources)(lookupByNameViaEither) shouldBe 
Left("Employee not found")
```
As for sequence, we can create a List of the employees we looked up by using the lookupByNameViaEither, and find out if we were looking for a missing person:
```scala
val employees = List(lookupByNameViaEither("Joe"), lookupByNameViaEither("Mary"))
val employeesAndOutsources = employees :+ lookupByNameViaEither("Foo")

Either.sequence(employees) shouldBe 
Right(List(Employee("Joe", "Finances", Some("Julie")), Employee("Mary", "IT", None)))

Either.sequence(employeesAndOutsources) shouldBe 
Left("Employee not found")
```
